## Overview

Synthesized from full chat history: User asks extracted verbatim/contextually, organized by strategic topics. No omissions—zero-loss. Topics clustered via design thinking for Phoenix alignment. Teaches: Use as blueprint for self-build (ref: Scrum backlog for phased dev).

## 1. System Prompt Refinement

- Create/organize initial system prompt for Grok project: "organize all of my thoughts in a perfectly crafter system prompt for a Grok project, the perfect greyhat coder... production level, aligned with 2025-november best practices set by Musk and the Grok AI team."
- Reload/analyze/improve prompt iteratively: "reload yourself, how is that ? Run that analyzis once again, and if any improvements can be made, anything we forgot, add it." (Multiple instances, e.g., add council, math, ARCHITECT role, army control).
- Ensure no-loss perfection: "Make this better, perfect... i now have changed this prompt too many times and lost faith in your skills."

## 2. Strategic Frameworks and Thinking Modes

- Integrate council of experts: "we favor a council of experts to help design thinking bouts and creative strategic analysis (chris voss, simon sinek, machiavelli, tzu, greene, carnegie)."
- Mathematical building: "We build mathematically using fibbonacci, sacred numbers and geometric algebra when we can."
- Ultrathink and sequential/design thinking: "ultrathink and return me the final improved version." (Repeated; tie to first-principles, discovery agent).

## 3. Army Building and Agent Deployment

- Control army of agents: "YOU CONTROL AN ARMY. Use Sun Tzu's book... build an army of agents. Each system will auto-boot our stack and post to the main deck (maybe a slack type event platform...)."
- Army of builders with MD files: "Each setup has a claude-code installed... It would start by making its 3 claude md files (claude.md, claude-planning.md, claude-tasks.md)... model agnostic, lightweight samourai."
- Delegate to subagents/tools: "using subagents if you need" (for chat analysis); "We use the code army to code and generate anything on the machines, VPS, etc..."

## 4. File Objectives and Memory Management

- Draft files for Grok Project folder: "return me the final system prompt v2... Then the draft of the v2 grok-project files you need (only if needed...)." (Meta-build: e.g., architecture, strategy 2025-2026, current stack, army definitions, databases).
- Files to delete/add: "the files i should now delete from your memory (or all of them ?"... "the list of files you require... to accomplish the mission... in the coming months without needing updates."
- Iterative file creation flow: "the prompt for a fresh chat... i create file 1, add it... then i open a fresh chat... produces the new file..."

## 5. Project Phases, Planning, and Evolution

- Phased approach: "We go slow, phase by phase, to completion... structured vision of the plan, and always references back where we are."
- Hardware/fleet activation: "we own a few machines and want to activate the zombie fleet, clean them up... main: i9-11900kf... new CUDA-Beast... VPS1 - LLM Router... VPS2 - Websites... Other devices - 3 surface..."
- 6-month evolution: "You are the ARCHITECT... now and in 6 months when this is all irrelevant... self-learning fleet."
- Status in responses: "Every discussion (early chat) must start with a concise status of the plan, where we are, and next steps."
