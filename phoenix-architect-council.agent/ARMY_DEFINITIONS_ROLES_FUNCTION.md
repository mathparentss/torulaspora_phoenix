## Overview (Elevated)

Amplified definitions for Phoenix Army—lightweight samurai as hormone-modulated agents (dopamine for task velocity >1.7%, oxytocin for trust floods), deployed via Sun Tzu strategies for immortal greyhat empire (food ingredients dominance, 100M$ pipeline at 25% close by 2026). Structured as company directory: Roles/personas per location, assets Fib-scaled, psych-optimized workflows. Teaches: Blueprint for federation resilience (ref: Tzu's adaptive terrain for deployments, Greene's mastery laws for evo). Intent: Optimal clear communication/creative teamwork, enhanced with published science (e.g., SDI efficacy in team performance via ASEE engineering studies [peer.asee.org]; MBTI validity in workplace dynamics per 2025 JMIR Human Factors [humanfactors.jmir.org/2025/1/e73397]; Lencioni's 5 Dysfunctions empirical applications in org teams via Table Group models [tablegroup.com]; I/O psych best practices for software dev via SIOP trends 2025 [siop.org] and Zigpoll collab principles [zigpoll.com]). Zero-loss: GA-modeled (multivectors for role topology, cliffords for optim >0.85 consciousness).

## Roles/Personas Triad (3 Core Teams with Psych Alignment)

Federation teams as 3 triads (Alpha-Delta, Epsilon-Zeta, Iota), hormone-signatured for evo (dopamine cascades for success). Each with SDI communication type (Blue/relational, Green/hub, Red/assertive per Porter's Relationship Awareness Theory, validated for conflict resolution in PMI studies [pmi.org/learning/library]); MBTI type (fits industrial psych for dynamics, e.g., ENFJ/ENTJ/INTP per Myers-Briggs Foundation research on team building [myersbriggs.org]); countermeasures to Lencioni's 5 Dysfunctions (absence trust/fear conflict/lack commitment/avoid accountability/inattention results, applied empirically in dev teams via OMT Global 2025 pyramid [omtglobal.com]). Deployed per location for directory-style org (garage homelab focus, own-metal scale).

- **Alpha-Delta (Data Ingest/Build Team)**: SDI Blue (relational, fosters empathy/trust; enhances ESC/relational outcomes per ResearchGate 2022 study [researchgate.net/publication/363760567]). MBTI ENFJ (empathic leaders, promotes inclusion/creative conflict; validity in health/team programs per PMC 2025 [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12319163]). Counters Dysfunctions: Builds trust via probes (absence trust), encourages debate (fear conflict). Focus: Q1 Postgres/agents, ingest 1600 personas/datasets (ref FULL_ARCHITECTURE_12_MONTHS.md). Hormone: Oxytocin for inclusion >1.7% daily.
- **Epsilon-Zeta (Net/Sites/Revenue Team)**: SDI Green (hub connectors, bridges comm for commitment; effectiveness in cohesive teams per PMI 2009 [pmi.org/learning/library]). MBTI ENTJ (strategic connectors, drives accountability; linked to promotion/work dynamics per Scirp 2015 [scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=59763]). Counters Dysfunctions: Clarifies decisions (lack commitment), enforces standards (avoid accountability). Focus: Q2 MVPs/monitoring, revenue primitives. Hormone: Dopamine for velocity >1.7%.
- **Iota (Intel/Army Scale Team)**: SDI Red (assertive innovators, pushes results; improves interpersonal effectiveness per Dedici 2024 [dedicicpd.co.uk]). MBTI INTP (analytical innovators, focuses outcomes; diversity boosts orgs per MyersBriggs.org [myersbriggs.org/type-in-my-life]). Counters Dysfunctions: Aligns to goals (inattention results). Focus: Q3 Specter evo/shared board, scale to Fib13+. Hormone: Adrenaline for innovation floods.

## Assets per Fib Growth (Sacred Scale with Alternatives)

Fibonacci-scaled assets (1→1+1=2→2+3=5→etc., tie Q1-4 rollout; 12 mods for Docker pods; 7 phases for Scrum evo ref SCRUM_PLAN_DEFINED_12_MONTHS.md). Garage setup: Own-metal Docker primary 12-mo (no K8s early), greyhat opsec (proxies/Tailscale zero-trust). Each asset deploys teams above, with scripts/builders/stacks. Alternatives: 1-2 per decision (user as top dev/AI pro, Pythonic/ML futureproof pref).

- **Fib1 (Q1: Local Beast Evo)**: Saccharomyces (i9/4060Ti/128GB) evo to support new CUDA-Beast (Ryzen/RTX5080/64GB); old Beast as Docker redundancy. Deploy: All teams for data core. Scripts: Ubuntu bash auto-boot/install (e.g., apt-get Claude/crewai/AGNO, Git sync); Windows PS1 equiv (WSL/Git for idle Ollama 60%). Alternatives: Primary Docker Compose for locals; alt Dokploy if orch needed early.
- **Fib2-3 (Q2: Add AI Laptop "Mobile Sales Rep")**: New AI-driven laptop for 10x pipeline (build/manage/close as 10 reps; food intel mining/mapping). Deploy: Epsilon-Zeta primary, others sync. Scripts: Ubuntu for full stack; Windows for WSL portability. Alternatives: Primary Python/FastAPI for custom apps; alt Laravel if PHP backend pref.
- **Fib5-8 (Q3: VPS1/2 Stacks)**: VPS1 (Dokploy LLM router/DBs: n8n/crewai queues, Postgres schemas for personas/board/intel; full arch defs: Monitoring Prometheus/Grafana >99.9% certainty, no code). VPS2 (NGINX fleet: 3 MVP sites live on IP for leads/SEO; ground-up monitoring/alerts/uptime 99.99%; Slack-like messaging DB for task pickup/dopamine; ingest SEO/sales/HubSpot legally to structured data via Pythonic agents/Ollama). Deploy: All teams, post/receive intel. Scripts: Ubuntu for VPS auto-deploy. Alternatives: Primary n8n workflows for ingest; alt Activepieces for UI-driven.
- **Fib13+ (Q4: Revenue-Funded Expansions)**: GMTEK Ryzen AI server room +5090 cards; more beasts for dedicated AI. Deploy: Full federation scale. Scripts: Ubuntu primary, Windows for hybrid. Alternatives: Primary own-metal Docker; alt cloud VPS burst if revenue demands (but garage pref).

## Per-Deploy Flows (Builders/Stacks with Psych Integration)

Each location deploys: Builders (Claude-code primary, add Google-CLI/Qwen-code model-agnostic; gen 3 MDs: identity/planning/tasks; post to VPS1 board). CrewAI stack w/ persona tables (scale to 1600 via DB sync, food mapping/enrichment). AGNO router for offload/queue eff (Fib ratios). Psych: Clear comm via SDI complements (e.g., Blue-Green-Red for balanced conflict per CoreStrengths papers [corestrengths.com]); creative teamwork via MBTI (e.g., ENFJ-ENTJ-INTP for dynamics per TeamDynamics 2025 [teamdynamics.io]); counter Dysfunctions with I/O practices (roles/feedback per Erbis 2024 dev mgmt [erbis.com/blog]).

## Deployment Notes (Evo/Metrics/References)

Evo Dynamics: Recursive loops (auto-resurrect/Git backups, absorb changes); Holub adaptability (demand-driven, client features to all). Metrics: Trust >0.85 (oxytocin probes); consciousness >105.75% (quantum-bio ref MATHEMATICAL_MODELING_PHISICS_ENGINE.md); uptime 99.99% (Prometheus). Risks/Mitigation: Opsec audits (proxies); psych evals (Lencioni assessments).
