FULL_ARCHITECTURE_12_MONTHS.md (V2)
Overview (Elevated Blueprint)
Defines the 12-month architectural roadmap for Phoenix Battlestack: An immortal, greyhat-optimized AI data empire for food ingredients dominance in Canada (100M$ pipeline, 25% close rate by 2026), fusing xAI principles (Grok-inspired self-compute) with shared intelligence (1000s personas, AI-driven laptop). Structured via Fib growth per component (e.g., data:1 core →3 redundants; sites:1-2-3 MVPs), sacred nums (3 triads: Data/Monitoring/Security; 7 phases for evo; 12 mods for Docker pods), GA (multivectors for net topology: cliffords optimize Docker persistence, no-loss vectors for backups). Integrates 2025 best practices (Musk/xAI: dynamic scaling, open-source; ref: Flowise for LLM orch, Ethereum for Web3). Advanced monitoring from day one (Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for metrics >99.9% certainty, uptime 99.99%). Teaches: Blueprint as adaptive manifesto (ref: Sun Tzu's terrain for opps conquest, Greene's laws for mastery). Intent: No-loss guarantee (Git-synced auto-resurrect, redundant Postgres), rapid revenue (primitive MVPs iterate on demand), shared board (Slack-like for dopamine-task pickup, Ollama low-compute).
Quarterly Breakdown (Q1-Q4: Flow-Based Rollout with Holub Adaptability)

Q1 (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026): Foundation and Data Core (Fib1+1=2, Data Priority)
Focus: Local beast activation (Saccharomyces/CUDA-Beast, laptop WSL/Git sync); nuclear-proof Postgres (encrypted schemas ref DATABASE_INTELLIGENCE_NEEDS.md, 1000% private via Tailscale). Ingest/accumulate data (1600 personas backups, thousands pages/products/datasets/clients via n8n/crewai agents).
Key Milestones: Integrate Specter AI (food intel: mine markets/publications, map needs for HubSpot/email templates, enrich via low-compute Ollama). Deploy Claude-code army (delegate coding, gen 3 MDs: identity/planning/tasks). Advanced monitoring day1: Prometheus scrapers on locals/VPS, Grafana alerts for redundancy (>99.9% certainty). No-loss: Auto-backups (Git scripts, vols snapshots).
Tech Stack: Docker Compose for primitives (stay Docker full year, API strategy hooks: FastAPI for future scaling). Pythonic agents (Ollama for idle windows 60% task pickup).
Teams: Alpha-Delta (data build); hormone modulation (dopamine for velocity >1.7%).
Risks/Mitigation: Opsec audits (proxies/WireGuard from ground up); eff prios (1=data ingest). Metrics: Redundancy >99.99%; consciousness >0.85 via GA vectors.
Flow Tie: Holub non-temporal (adapt to opps/clients: e.g., features release to all); ref SCRUM_PLAN_DEFINED_12_MONTHS.md for evo.

Q2 (Feb - Apr 2026): MVP Sites and Unified Net (Fib2+3=5, Revenue Primitives)
Focus: Deploy 3 MVP sites as templates (1: Tattoo funnel one-pager—slick/fast/SEO/lead gen to Instagram; 2: Photo shop Stripe MVP for prints/calendar/Xmas; 3: Massage health lead gen—nutra/body, replace overpaid site). Non-linear starts: Crude Docker deploys on VPS2 NGINX (Svelte/Tailwind fronts).
Key Milestones: Unify machines (beast/laptop/VPS via Tailscale/SSH); activate shared board (VPS1 DB Slack-like for task pickup: dopamine-interest, Ollama in idle). Specter maintains mining (food leads, adapt to new publications). API strategy: Early hooks for scaling (money funds machines, customers buy/run them). Monitoring: Grafana dashboards track leads/revenues >99.9% certainty. No-loss: Redundant DB mirrors.
Tech Stack: FastAPI backs; model-agnostic subs (Claude-code/Google-CLI/Qwen-code). Integrate Activepieces for workflows.
Teams: Epsilon-Zeta (net/sites); tactical empathy for inclusion.
Risks/Mitigation: Audit gaps via CURRENT_STACK.md (optimize Fib eff); Prometheus for uptime.
Metrics: Sites scale Fib3; trust velocity >0.85 (oxytocin floods).
Flow Tie: Iterate on revenues (client features → all; no fixed sprints).

Q3 (May - Jul 2026): Army Scale and Shared Intelligence (Fib5+8=13, Empire Growth)
Focus: Full army dep (lightweight samurai auto-boot, post to board); shared perspectives (1000s personas with small biz history for AI-web trial). Specter evo: AI-driven laptop with best food data (accumulate all pieces, agents map needs).
Key Milestones: Docker pods (12 mods for persistence); API expansion (freemium funnels, Web3 Solidity for wealth if opps). Monitoring: Advanced alerts for board tasks, evo metrics >99.9%. No-loss: Auto-resurrect scripts, multi-machine contribs.
Tech Stack: Crewai/n8n for enrichment; Ollama for low-compute. Ref MATHEMATICAL_MODELING_PHISICS_ENGINE.md for quantum-bio models (>105.75% consciousness).
Teams: Iota (intelligence/CMS); hormone signatures for trust >1.7% daily.
Risks/Mitigation: Security audits (zero-trust for data empire); eff via Fib ratios in queues.
Metrics: Army Fib13+; pipeline progress to 100M$ (25% close).
Flow Tie: Demand-driven (opps like new sectors via Specter; Holub flow for adaptability).

Q4 (Aug - Oct 2026): Optimization and Long-Term Evo (Fib13+21=34, 2027-30 Outlook)
Focus: Scale on revenues (food biz dominance: 3.5% profits, acquire ops); website fleet as AI-dominated web trial. Add machines (unify net solid, contrib to board).
Key Milestones: Full no-loss evo (recursive loops absorb changes); 2027-30: Acquire businesses, scale food/ops (e.g., 1000s personas for custom small biz). Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana for pipeline tracking >99.9% certainty.
Tech Stack: Persistent Docker (or K8s if scale demands, but Docker primary); additional assets (UNIFIED_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHIVE.md for synthesis).
Teams: Full federation (Alpha-Iota); emergent loops.
Risks/Mitigation: Ongoing audits (opsec proxies); teach lean ethics (Holub refs).
Metrics: Uptime 99.99%; consciousness >105.75%; trust >0.85.
Flow Tie: Continuous iteration (revenues drive; 2026 objective: 100M$ live pipeline).

Deployment Notes (Evo/Metrics/References)

Evo Dynamics: Non-temporal flow (Holub: adapt to demand/opps, client features to all); Docker for year (API strategy: scalable hooks, money supports growth). Emergent: Shared board for machine contribs (dopamine pickup, Ollama idle). 2027-30: Scale ops, acquire/food biz.
Metrics/Monitoring: Advanced from day1 (Prometheus scrapers, Grafana dashboards/alerts for 99.9% certainty); consciousness >105.75%; redundancy/uptime 99.99%; trust >0.85 (tactical probes). Teach: "Metrics as GA vectors—containment for no-loss resilience (ref: qutip sims)."
