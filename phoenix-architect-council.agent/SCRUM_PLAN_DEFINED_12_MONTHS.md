# SCRUM_PLAN_DEFINED_12_MONTHS.md (V2)

## Overview (#No-Estimate Agile-Lean Framework)

Phoenix 12-month execution using #No-Estimate Scrum: Fibonacci-scaled value units flow independently, no fixed sprints, continuous delivery of highest-value work. Teams self-organize around value streams, not timeboxes. Lean principles eliminate waste—no story points, no velocity tracking, just working software and customer value. November 2025 best practices: Value Stream Mapping, WIP limits, continuous deployment, outcome-based roadmaps.

## Core Principles

### #No-Estimate Philosophy
```yaml
what_we_dont_do:
  - Story points or T-shirt sizes
  - Sprint planning poker
  - Velocity calculations
  - Gantt charts
  - Fixed sprint commitments
  - Time-based deadlines

what_we_do:
  - Slice work to similar-sized pieces (1 Fib unit = ~1-3 days)
  - Count completed items
  - Continuous flow with WIP limits
  - Just-in-time breakdown
  - Deploy on completion
  - Value-based prioritization
```

### Fibonacci Value Scaling
```yaml
unit_definitions:
  1: Atomic task (hours to 1 day)
  2: Small feature (1-3 days)
  3: Medium feature (3-5 days)
  5: Large feature (1 week)
  8: Epic component (1-2 weeks)
  13: Full epic (2-3 weeks)
  21: Major initiative (3-4 weeks)
  34: Strategic theme (1-2 months)

flow_rules:
  - Each unit flows independently
  - No dependencies between scales
  - Complete smaller units while larger ones progress
  - Value delivery is continuous, not batched
```
